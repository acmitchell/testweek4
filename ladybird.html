			<h1>Ladybird</h1>
			<p>Ladybirds are generally considered useful insects and one of the greatest allies of the farmer and the gardener as many species feed on aphids or scale insects, which are pests in gardens, agricultural fields, orchards, and similar places. They are nature’s own ‘pest’ controllers and are more effective than poisonous chemicals.
            Their bright colour and pattern not only make them attractive visitors to the garden, but also help to protect them by warning potential predators of their distastefulness. They exude an unpleasant yellow substance (reflex blood) from their leg joints when attacked which is rich in toxic alkaloids. Their colouring is likely a reminder to any animals that have tried to eat their kind before: “I taste awful.” A threatened ladybird may both play dead and secrete the unappetizing substance to protect itself.   </p>
